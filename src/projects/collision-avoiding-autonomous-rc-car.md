summary: This was my senior capstone I did while I was getting my BSCS. It's a
  very modular system that I continue to pick pieces out of to make multiple
  versions of this project over the years, including scaling this up to work
  with my daughter's power wheel car! These are the original project files I use
  and expand on when I start working on a new project that fits this scope.
