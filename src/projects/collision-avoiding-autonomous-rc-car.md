This was my senior capstone I did while I was getting my BSCS. It's a very modular system that I continue to picked pieces out of to make multiple different version of this project over the years, including scaling this up to work with my daughters power wheel car! These are the original project files that I use and expand on when I start working on a new project that fits this scope.
